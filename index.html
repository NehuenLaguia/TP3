                <p>We are a small company who believes that a pet's mental health is just as important as its physical health. Boredom and anxiety are common traits among pets that are not challenged enough mentally - and we see this manifest as "bad" and destructive behavior.</p>
                <p>That's why we at FunPetz are singularly focused on finding products that can keep your pet physically and mentally engaged.</p>

After running her around with the flirt pole in the early evening in our backyard, she no longer has the energy to be destructive."</p>

                <p>"At first I didn't believe it would be possible to teach my dog to use these buttons. But after watching videos on YouTube I wanted to give this a try. After a few weeks of training on the first button, she has finally learned the connection between the button and the desired action. Amazing!"
